# Simulation-and-optimization-of-production-of-building-and-units-in-StarCraft-2

Introduction:

In a typical match of the popular real-time strategy game Starcraft 21 up to eight human players
compete in two teams and try to destroy the enemy base. A match can be divided up into three
different phases: early, mid, and late game. In the first phase, the players try to build up their main
base and decide for a certain opening strategy, where one can focus either on fast expansion to increase
later income, developing straightly new technology to build better units, or quickly build as many units
as possible in order to rush the enemy, i. e. to attack as soon as possible. The best opening strategy
depends on the map, the race the participants have chosen, and also the opponents’ strategies.

Part1:

  Input: Build lists, Output: Json File
  • decide if build list is valid
  • if it is valid:
  • write detailed log in JSON format

Part2: 

  write a build list optimizer using a genetic algorithm
two optimization scenarios:
  • build as many units as possible in given time
  • build a certain (advanced) unit / building as fast as possible
